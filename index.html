        <p>December brought a new jailbreak collective evad3rs an untethered jailbreak for iOS out seven. This jailbreak called Evasi0n 7, caused quite a stir by adding Taig an alternative App Store for Chinese aircraft. Also worked the known alternative app store Cydia badly on iOS 7.</p>

<p>Last weekend there are a number updats for Evasi0n jailbreak released. Bugs that caused the iPad 2 and iPad mini Retina after the jailbreak were endless reboot are solved. There is also support for iOS 1.7 beta 3 and Cydia works really smoothly, making jaibreakers again have available numerous tools and tweaks. After a false start in December, the Evasi0n jailbreak seems back on track.</p>

<p><strong>The latest iOS 7.1 beta is now also jailbreakable.</strong></p>

<p>The evasi0n jailbreak came in February of 2013 for the first time, it was the first untethered jailbreak for iOS 6. The flawless operation and quick updates had evad3rs (Source: <a href=https://medium.com/@jaimeIOS/jailbreaking-ios-6-1-on-your-iphone-4-a-short-history-lesson-1c0975f1dc13>Medium</a>), the team behind the jailbreak as soon as a good name. Upon the release of the jailbreak for iOS 7 on <a href="http://ios7pro.weebly.com">http://ios7pro.weebly.com</a>. However, out of the turn. The bundling of the alternative Chinese app store 'Taig' at the Chinese iPhone jailbreak led to many common questions about privacy and illegal software in Taig would be present.</p>

<p>Evad3rs responded through two comprehensive statements and Taig removed from his jailbreak. With the arrival of iOS 7 is the hype about jailbreaking of iOS devices has long been waning. Many tweaks from jailbreaks have found their way into iOS 7, Apple also makes it increasingly difficult to find bugs that allow a jailbreak. Or evasi0n also among the final release of iOS 7.1 will continue to operate, therefore the question.</p>
<p> So if you're not clear how all of this works, then <a href=http://ios7pro.weebly.com/blog/the-jailbreak-process-explained>go visit this post</a>, which explains the entire process involved.</p>
